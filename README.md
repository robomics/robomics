# 👋 Hi, I'm Roberto

I'm a bioinformatics researcher building high-performance tools and workflows to analyze complex genomic data.

## 🔬 About Me

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Jonas Paulsen's group at the University of Oslo.
My work focuses on designing efficient and user-friendly bioinformatics software, with an emphasis on performance and reproducibility.

## 📈 Current Work

- Developing tools to detect statistically significant interactions and architectural stripes from Hi-C data
- Analyzing high-throughput sequencing datasets: Hi-C, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq

## 🧬 Featured Projects

- [hictk](https://github.com/paulsengroup/hictk) - blazing fast toolkit to work with .hic and .cool files
- [MoDLE](https://github.com/paulsengroup/modle) - high-performance stochastic modeling of DNA loop extrusion interactions
- [StripePy](https://github.com/paulsengroup/StripePy) - detects architectural stripes in 3C and Hi-C contact maps using geometric reasoning
- [call_tad_cliques](https://github.com/robomics/call_tad_cliques) - Nextflow workflow to call TAD cliques
- [2022-mcf10a-cancer-progression](https://github.com/paulsengroup/2022-mcf10a-cancer-progression) - scripts and analysis workflows for [this study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.26.568711v2): _Loss of multi-level 3D genome organization during breast cancer progression_

## 🤝 Open to Collaborations

- Projects involving SIMD, CUDA, or performance optimization
- Exploring Rust for systems-level bioinformatics tooling 🦀

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

C++, Python, POSIX shell, R, Nextflow, Git, Docker, GitHub Actions, SLURM
