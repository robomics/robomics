### Hi there :wave:

My name is Roberto, and I am passionate about software engineering and biology.

I am a postdoctoral fellow in Jonas Paulsen's group at the University of Oslo where I develop novel bioinformatics workflows and tools with a focus on performance, correctness, and ease of use.

When I am not developing new tools, I spend my time analyzing all kinds of high-throughput sequencing data, including Hi-C, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and WGS.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tool to identify statistically significant interactions from Hi-C data
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects using SIMD and/or CUDA
- ðŸŒ± I'm looking forward to learning a new programming language (most likely Rust ðŸ¦€)

If you want to contact me, you can do so via
